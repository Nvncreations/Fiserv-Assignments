Alice followed the rabbit down the hole and found herself falling.
She tried to remember how many miles down she had fallen.

Alice began to think she must be getting very far underground.
Suddenly, thump! Down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves.
The fall was over at last, and she looked around in wonder.
Before her was a long, low hall, lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.

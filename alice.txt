Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank.
So she was considering in her own mind whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies.
Suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"
When she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural.
The Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on.
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it.
She was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
